#Take this scenario for example: David makes a goal to write a book with
# a minimum of 300 pages. He starts writing every day and works really 
# hard but along the way, he loses track of how many more pages he has 
# written and how much more he needs to write. 
#So rather than panicking David simply counts the number of pages he has 
#already written and he instantly determines his progress and knows how much 
#further he needs to go. allows you to hit your target and reach your goal.
