The following observations were made in this regard : \n\n1) A funder, who is not linked to a project, can perform the following tasks, with regards to that project : \na) Edit project details\nb) Add/Edit a tranche\nc) Add/Edit values for a parameter\nd) Generate a report for any project \ne) Add a note to any project\nf) View/Delete user role\n\n2) A file uploaded by a user can be edited by anyone else\n\n\nAffected URLs\nhttps://pmusectest.goodcsr.in/project/add/?slug=\u003cproject-slug\u003e\nhttps://pmusectest.goodcsr.in/project/budget/tranche/?slug=\u003cproject-slug\u003e\nhttps://pmusectest.goodcsr.in/project/parameter/values/manage/?id=\u003cid\u003e\nhttps://pmusectest.goodcsr.in/project/budget/tranche/?slug=\u003cproject-slug\u003e\u0026tranche_id=\u003cid\u003e\nhttps://pmusectest.goodcsr.in/report/final/design/?slug=\u003cproject-slug\u003e\u0026report_id=\u003cid\u003e\u0026div_id=\u0026key=\nhttps://pmusectest.goodcsr.in/dashboard/add/note/?slug=\u003cproject-slug\u003e\nhttps://pmusectest.goodcsr.in/upload/edit/?model=\u003cmodel\u003e\u0026obj_id=\u003cid\u003e\u0026id=\u003cid\u003e\n\n\nImpact: An existing user of GoodCSR-PMU application can perform actions to which the user should not be able to, as per the user's role. This is against the principle of **least privilege**, which states that a person should be allowed to perform. only those actions to which he/she is authorised. If an attacker is able to register with the application, or somehow obtain the credentials of any existing user, the attacker would be able to exploit this vulnerability to change the data corresponding to various projects.\n\nIt is recommended to implement role-based access throughout the application. Users should be allowed to perform only those actions for which they have a documented business purpose.","state":"opened","iid":104,"updated_by_id":6,"confidential":false,"due_date":"2018-11-23","moved_to_id":null,"lock_version":2,"time_estimate":0,"relative_position":1073745210,"last_edited_at":"2018-11-22T04:32:13.541Z","last_edited_by_id":163,"discussion_locked":null,"closed_at":null,"events":[],"timelogs":[],"notes":[{"id":15121,"note":"added

Through a script, they would also be redirected to another page.\n\n{{\"https://pmusectest.goodcsr.in/project/add/?slug=\u003cproject-slug\u003e \"}}\n\nImpact: If an attacker is able to obtain user credentials of any user, the attacker can create a project and enter malicious scripts in the summary page and add the victims to the project as funder and implementation partner. When the victims open the project from the projects dropdown menu, the project summary page would launch and the script would be executed on their browsers. The attacker can use this vulnerability to steal cookies, take over victim's session, redirect the victim to a malicious site etc.\n\nIt is recommended to create a white-list of characters needed by the application and should disallow all requests containing any other character. Furthermore, the application should HTML escape the value of all user controlled parameters before including them in the HTML
